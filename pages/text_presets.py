regarded as the most significant Polish composer since Szymanowski, and possibly the greatest Polish composer since 
Chopin His compositions—of which he was a notable conductor—include representatives of most traditional genres,

best known works are his four symphonies, the Variations on a Theme by Paganini (1941), the Concerto for Orchestra (
1954), and his cello concerto (1970) """
